Can you feel it?
Something's different
Can you feel it?
Something's different
Can you feel it?
Something's different
Can you feel it?
Something's different

Feeling so wrong and confused
Feeling fucked up, out of tune
Feeling fucked up and confused
Feeling so wrong and out of tune

She's speaking gibberish
She's feigning ignorance
Her light is flickering
She's like black licorice
She sparks my interest
She's just so different
She tastes sweet bitterness
She's like black licorice

Dark emo thoughts inside my head
Better not think, better not say it
Always shaking like a hummingbird

Always shaking, shaking, shaking like a hummingbird

Can you feel it?
Something's different
Can you feel it?
Something's different
Can you feel it?
Something's different
Can you feel it?
Something's different

Always been a little different from the other girls
Always been a firecracker and a thunderbird
Born to be a fucking demon from the underworld
Always shaking, always flutter like a hummingbird

She's speaking gibberish
She's feigning ignorance
Her light is flickering
She's like black licorice
She sparks my interest
She's just so different
She tastes sweet bitterness
She's like black licorice
